Hello, visitor! 

This is my first real project for a client! (This is demo version, the website is not finished yet)
The client is a German cleaning company that is relocating it's business in Bulgaria and asked me to create simple and modern website with little functionality. I accepted the task and we started the process of building the website. 

The whole idea of the website - design, logo, colors, functionality is created by me according to the client's preferences.

I learned a lot of things during the process of building the website and now I am even more interested in building more projects and learning new technologies.

Technologies used - HTML , CSS , Javascript, Bootstrap, AOS library
